# IntroductionÂ¶
# In this project, you will classify aircraft damage using a pre-trained VGG16 model and generate captions using a Transformer-based pretrained model.
#
# Project Overview
# Aircraft damage detection is essential for maintaining the safety and longevity of aircraft. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the classification of aircraft damage into two categories: "dent" and "crack." For this, we will utilize feature extraction with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify the damage from aircraft images. Additionally, we will use a pre-trained Transformer model to generate captions and summaries for the images.
#
# Aim of the Project
# The goal of this project is to develop an automated model that accurately classifies aircraft damage from images. By the end of the project, you will have trained and evaluated a model that utilizes feature extraction from VGG16 for damage classification. This model will be applicable in real-world damage detection within the aviation industry. Furthermore, the project will showcase how we can use a Transformer-based model to caption and summarize images, providing a detailed description of the damage.
#
# Final Output
# A trained model capable of classifying aircraft images into "dent" and "crack" categories, enabling automated aircraft damage detection.
# A Transformer-based model that generates captions and summaries of images

# To achieve the above objectives, you will complete the following tasks:
#
# Task 1: Create a valid_generator using the valid_datagen object
# Task 2: Create a test_generator using the test_datagen object
# Task 3: Load the VGG16 model
# Task 4: Compile the model
# Task 5: Train the model
# Task 6: Plot accuracy curves for training and validation sets
# Task 7: Visualizing the results
# Task 8: Implement a Helper Function to Use the Custom Keras Layer
# Task 9: Generate a caption for an image using the using BLIP pretrained model
# Task 10: Generate a summary of an image using BLIP pretrained model
